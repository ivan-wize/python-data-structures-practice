# Youâ€™re automating the analysis of battery test sessions. Each session is a list of power usage readings (in watts), one per minute.
# Write a Python function that:
#     Accepts a list of power readings from a test session.
#     Splits the session into continuous segments where power usage is above a given threshold (e.g., device is "active").
#     Returns a list of tuples, each representing a segment: (start_index, end_index), inclusive.
