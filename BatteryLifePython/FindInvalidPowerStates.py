# Youâ€™re working on automation for validating power-related logs from battery tests. 
# You receive a list of log entries captured during a device test session. 
# Each entry is a dictionary with a timestamp and a power_state, such as "charging", "discharging", "idle", or "error".
# Write a Python function that:
#     Scans the logs and identifies any entries with invalid or unexpected power_state values.
#     Returns a list of all such invalid entries (the full dictionary for each).
# Assume valid states are: "charging", "discharging", "idle"

    def findInvalidPowerStates(self, logs):

#     We iterate through each log entry once, where n is the number of logs.
# Space Complexity: O(k)
