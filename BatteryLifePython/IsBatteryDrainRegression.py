# You're testing a new software release on a mobile device. You collect hourly battery percentage readings during idle conditions for two builds:
#     previous_build: Battery percentages over 5 hours from an older stable version
#     new_build: Battery percentages over 5 hours from the current build under test
# Write a Python function that:
#     Checks whether the battery drain in the new build is worse than in the previous build.
#     Returns True if the new build has regressed (drains faster), otherwise False.
# Assume battery levels only go down or stay flat (never up).
