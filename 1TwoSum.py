# Explanation:
#     Hash Map Approach:
#         Use a dictionary (num_to_index) to store each number and its corresponding index as we iterate through the list.

#     Complement Check:
#         For each number, calculate the complement (i.e., target - num).
#         Check if the complement is already in the dictionary.
#             If yes, weâ€™ve found the pair, so return their indices.
#             If no, add the current number and its index to the dictionary.

# Time Complexity: O(n), since we traverse the list only once.
# Space Complexity: O(n), for storing elements in the dictionary
